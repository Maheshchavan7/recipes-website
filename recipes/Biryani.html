    <h3>Steps to Make The Royal Biryani</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <p> Prepare saffron-kewra water and chop veggies   <br>
            To make a delightful chicken biryani dish firstly soak saffron  <br>
            in water to prepare saffron water (One tsp saffron can be soaked in 1/4 cup water). <br> 
            Next, mix kewra drops in water and mix well to make kewra water. Set them aside for later usage. <br>
             Now chop the onion and coriander leaves and keep them aside.</p>

         <li>Step 2</li>
         <p>
            Meanwhile, heat refined oil in a deep bottomed pan. <br>
            Once the oil is hot enough, add cumin seeds, bay leaf, green cardamom, black cardamom, <br> 
            cloves in it, and saute for about a minute. <br>
            Then, add chopped onion to it and saute until pink. Now, add chicken <br>
            into it with slit green chillies, turmeric, salt to taste, ginger garlic paste,  <br>
            red chilli powder and green chilli paste. Mix well all the spices and cook for 2-3 minutes.  <br>
            Then, add hung curd into it and give a mix. (Make sure the chicken is washed properly and patted dry  <br>
            before adding it to the dish) 
         </p>

         <li>Step 3</li>
         <p>
            Cook biryani on low heat for 5-6 minutes <br>
            Turn the flame to medium again and add garam masala in it along with ginger julienned, <br>
            coriander and mint leaves. Add kewra water, rose water and saffron water in it. <br>
            Cook till the chicken is tender. Then add 1 cup cooked rice and spread evenly. <br>
            Then add saffron water and pour ghee over it. You can now cook the dish without the <br> 
            lid or cover it with a lid to give a dum-effect due to the steam formation.
         </p>

         <li>Step 4</li>
         <p>
            Serve hot chicken biryani with your favourite chutney or raita <br> 
            Cook for 15-20 minutes with a closed lid and garnish with 1 tbsp fried onions and coriander leaves. <br>
            Serve hot chicken biryani with raita of your choice. Enjoy!

     <h3>Tips</h3>

    <ul>
     <li>
        The first and foremost important thing to take care of while preparing chicken biryani recipe is,
        always use a heavy-bottomed pan as you would not want the chicken getting cooked.
     </li>   

     <li>
        The restaurant-style chicken biryani recipe uses the whole chicken in preparation and the 
        chicken breast can dry when cooking at home. It's always suggested to use chicken thigh
     </li>

     <li>
        If you want your chicken to be juicier in your biryani, do not remove the bone.
     </li>

     <li>
        If your cooked rice has turned sticky, 
        spread it on a plate and leave it for 5 minutes. The rice will be separate and fluffy again.
     </li>

     <li>
        Freshly pound spices bring out the best taste in Chicken Biryani Recipe, 
        so make sure that you dry roast all the whole spices for a good 2-3 minutes and then pound or grind them.
     </li>
    </ul>
